# Cosmon Analytics

This is a dashboard for the ki blockchain game Cosmon. 

Every data has been taken directly from the blockchain, in order to be as accurate as possible.

The purpose is to grant players access to their match data in an easy way, while containing multiple statistics to enhance their experience.

This tool was made with the approval of the cosmon team.

:warning: The data is reset every league, so make sure to save it before the league ends.
